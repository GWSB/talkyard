<p>Hello @username,</p>

<p>
@* SECURITY, UNPOLITE [20KCQ5Y] what if Mallory chooses username "@alice_you_are_stupid" and then
  adds email address alices.address@example.com? Then Alice will get this email, and see the text
  "alice_you_are_stupid" and maybe gets sad, & angry at the website, rather than Mallory, and clicks
  "mark as spam"?
  Should the username not be included here, because of that? Or what if Mallory creates a website
  like "alice-is-so-stupid-123.example.com" and specifies Alice's address as the owner's address?
  Solution?: If there's a create-site domain, then always include a "Report this" link,
  so the website or user can be investigated and maybe removed. *@
To finish adding email address @emailAddress to user @username at @grayBoringLink(siteAddress),
please click <a href="@Html(safeVerificationUrl)">this link</a>.
</p>

<p>
(If however you don't know what this is about, don't click the link. @* SECURITY do what instead?
Clicking a "wrong address" link that sends a notification to the user? (which is possible here since
the user already exists) *@
Maybe someone typed the wrong address.)
