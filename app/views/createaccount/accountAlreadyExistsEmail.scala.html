<p>Hello,</p>

<p>
You attempted to create a new account at <a href="@origin">@siteAddress</a>,
with email address <tt>@emailAddress</tt>, but you already have such an account.
If you don't remember your password, you can
<a href="@origin@controllers.routes.ResetPasswordController.showResetPasswordPage">
  reset it here.</a>
</p>

<p>Kind regards,<br>
Debiki
