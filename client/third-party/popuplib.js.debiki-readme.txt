popuplib.js opens a OpenID Provider login page in a popup, so we don't have to
redirect the main window itself to the login page.

From: http://step2.googlecode.com/svn/code/java/trunk/example-consumer/src/main/webapp/popuplib.js
SVN revision: r373
Date: Mar 6, 2009

Currently, only a few popuplib.js helper functions are in use — Lift-Web
generates a <form> and I use jQuery to submit it, so popuplib.js's most
interesting function (?), popupManager.createPopupOpener, is not in use.
— Now I commented it out. /kajmagnus
