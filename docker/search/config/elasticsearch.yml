# 1) Use a single index for all sites, but many shards, and route to the shard
# derived from the site id. Then only one shard will be touched, when indexing
# or querying. Therefore it's okay with 50 or 100 shards.
# 2) If a single site becomes super large, we can migrate it into its own index.
# See: https://www.elastic.co/videos/big-data-search-and-analytics/ (a video)
# 3) (Could keep current hot data in one index, and move old discussions that have
# been closed, to an old & slow index on cheaper hardware. Combine time & user data flow?)
